The goal of fplboard is to create a dashboard to easily extract useful information from the FPL api.

This dashboard is built on top of [fplscrapR](https://github.com/wiscostret/fplscrapR), but also has its own native functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of fplboard like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("thomaszwagerman/fplboard")

library(fplboard)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows a function that return an expected points (EP) table for a given miniweek.

Under the hood it relies on `fplscrapR`'s `get_league_entries()` and `get_player_info()` functions. 

Let's have a look at FPL Focal's mini league top 10 for EP in gameweek 1:

```{r example, echo = FALSE}
library(fplboard)
library(knitr)

fpl_focal <- get_ep_for_league(league_number = 486, gameweek = 1)
kable(fpl_focal[1:10,])

```
