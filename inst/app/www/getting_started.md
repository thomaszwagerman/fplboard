# What is fplboard?

The goal of fplboard is to provide a simple dashboard to visualise FPL’s
data.

## Past, Present & Future

The dashboard has been divided up into three categories:

**The Past:** here you can look at your team’s or mini-league’s past
performance. Who gained the most captaincy points (TBC), who left the
most points on the bench, and who was the most improved?

**The Present:** look at the state of your team. How many expected
points will you get this gameweek, and are there any players not
currently in your team who will do better?

**The Future:** plan your next moves, using expected points. Spy on your
mini-league rivals, are any of them expected to gain more points than
you this gameweek?

## Getting started with fplboard

To get started with fplboard you’ll need a couple of things: the team
number of the team you are interested in, and the minileague number of
the minileague you’re interested in.

### Obtaining Team Number

You’ll find your team number in your URL when you navigate to the
‘Points’ tab on FPL.

### Obtaining League Number

You’ll find your minileague number in your URL when you navigate to
‘Leagues & Cups’, and then select a minileague.

For example, the overall standings’ league number is 314.

Happy number crunching!
