# Thank you for using fplboard!

## fplboard

**fplboard** has been written in R, and is a
[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application written as a package
using the [golem framework](https://engineering-shiny.org/index.html).

The source code is open and free to re-use. Contributions, code or
otherwise, are encouraged!

You can find the Github repository
[here](https://github.com/thomaszwagerman/fplboard), or above under the
‘Source Code’ tab.

This dashboard is built on top of another R package,
[fplscrapR](https://github.com/wiscostret/fplscrapR), without which this
website would not be possible. Do go and check that out!
